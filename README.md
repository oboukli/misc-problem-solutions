# Solutions in C/C++ to Miscellaneous Programming Problems

This is a repository of modern coding showcases and solutions to various
popular programming problems, written in C90, C++17, C++20, and C++23.

For some of the said problems, multiple solutions of varying efficiency
and trade-offs are provided, along with benchmarks.

All solutions are driven by extensive automated testing, in addition to being
statically and dynamically analyzed, and compiled under strict rules with
the latest Clang, GCC, and MSVC compilers.

## Technical showcases

The following is a partial list of standards, practices, paradigms, and tools
leveraged by this project:

- C (standard C90) and C++ (standard C++17, C++20, and C++23)
- The C and C++ standard libraries
- Strongly-typed approach, leveraging C++ templates and C++20 concepts
- Const correctness where applicable--except for fields
- Functional programming
- Strict standard conformance and strict compilation rules
- Static analysis with Clang Tidy and Microsoft C++ Code Analysis
- Dynamic analysis
- LLVM-based sanitizer tools
- CMake
- Clean Git history and configuration
- Extensive testing using Catch2 and CTest
- Development dependency management using vcpkg
- Own opinionated Clang Format configuration
- Conventional Commits
- GitHub Actions CI
- Benchmarking using nanobench
- Microsoft DevSkim
- EditorConfig
- Markdown
- Diagraming with Mermaid
