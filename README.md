# Solutions to miscellaneous coding problems

This is a repository of modern coding showcases, and solutions for various
coding problems, written in C90, and C++17, C++20, and C++23.

The solutions are not necessarily optimal or meant as best practice.

## Technical showcases

The following is a partial list of standards, practices, software,
and ideas leveraged by this project:

- C (standard C99)
- C++ (standard C++17, C++20, and C++23)
- C++ STL
- Strongly-typed approach, leveraging C++ templates and concepts
- Const correctness where applicable--except for fields
- Functional programming
- Strict compilation
- CMake
- Clean Git history and configuration
- Extensive testing using Catch2 and CTest
- Development dependency management using vcpkg
- Opinionated Clang Format configuration
- Conventional Commits
- GitHub Actions CI
- Benchmarking using nanobench
