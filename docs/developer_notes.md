# Developer notes

## Goals

This work aims at achieving:

- correctness (including semantic correctness of code, among other things)
- conformance to international standards (C, C++, Unicode, etc.)
- portability to at least three major platforms
- efficient and optimized runtime performance
- compatibility with at least four stable major compilers
- producing open and free (libre) deliverables

Non-goals include:

- Providing solutions in a language other than C and C++
- Supporting C standards aside from C90
- Supporting C++ standards before C++23
- Fast compilation
- Supporting non-latest compiler versions
- Optimizing for a specific processor or platform

## Architecture and design

### Dynamic memory allocation

Code that directly make use of dynamic allocation, i.e. by calling `malloc` and
`new` directly, is isolated into build artifacts postfixed with `_experimental`
in the name.

The `forfun_c_experimental` static library, and the `test_driver_experimental`
executable utilize [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc).

### Exception safety-aware design

Functions and methods are annotated with the `noexcept` specifier where
applicable. In addition, special care is taken to order invocations of throwing
functions and methods to achieve the strongest exception safety possible.

An example can be seen in the
[`bucket_sort_based::top_frequent`](../include/forfun/top_k_frequent_elements.hpp)
strategy where a call to `std::sort` is delayed till after the
potentially-throwing `std::vector` constructor.

## Internal checks

The design avoids fail-fast guards as it favors performance and composability.

### Static and shared libraries

All ForFun libraries can be built and linked as static or dynamic (shared), with
only the `forfun_c_experimental` library being an exception, as it is meant to
be statically linked. This is because the `forfun_c_experimental` library
defines, and makes available externally, the `g_forfun_mem` global state
variable.

### Thread safety

The code is not guaranteed to be thread-safe.

### Curiously recurring template pattern

An occurrence of the curiously recurring template pattern (CRTP), as a mixin
utilizing C++23's explicit object parameter, can be seen in
`list_iterator_helper`.

## Compiler standards

### Source code charset

All source code in this repository should be encoded in
UTF-8 without byte order mark (BOM). This is important to guarantee sources
containing characters outside the
[standard C++ charset](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/charset),
are compiled correctly. An example is the file `test/palindrome_test.cpp`.

For the MSVC compiler, the command-line option `/source-charset:utf-8`
should be passed, as seen in the `CMakePresets.json` file.

### Compiler support

The code is written in standards-compliant C90 and C++23 and is known to compile
with the following compilers.

- Apple Clang 17.0
- Clang 20.1
- GCC 14.2
- MSVC 19.43

The code passes most recommended compiler diagnostic options. Compiler options
are configured by means of CMake presets in `CMakePresets.json`.

See also the GitHub Actions CI configuration in
`.github/workflows/building-and-testing.yml`.

## Code annotations

The code attempts to use modern C++ attributes where supported, and experiments
with the [Guidelines Support Library (GSL)](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL).

## Code style

Opinionated modern C++ style, partially inspired by Prettier, managed with
EditorConfig, Clang Format, and VS Code extension indent-rainbow.

Some notable style choices:

- Type qualifiers (e.g. `const`) on the right
- Lines restricted to eighty characters
- Generally avoid alignment. Always indent in multiples of four spaces
- Generous amount of blank lines to separate code blocks

## Dependencies and dependency management

Beside the standard C++ and C libraries, the non-development build targets avoid
external dependencies. An exception is the `forfun_experimental` target, which
makes use of the Guidelines Support Library (GSL).

Almost all external dependencies are managed with vcpkg and its manifest mode.
The exceptions are Google FuzzTest, and vcpkg itself, which are manually managed
(cloned) with Git.

A list of vcpkg-managed dependencies can be seen in `vcpkg.json`.

## Quality assurance

### Type safety and const-correctness

Initialization of variables follow the list-initialization syntax where
applicable.

Special care is taken to declare objects as `const` and `constexpr` where
applicable. This includes declaring pass-by-value parameters as `const`.

### Unit tests

The majority of runtime unit tests are hosted in the `test_driver` executable,
while the compile-time tests are compiled with the `static_test_driver`
one.

Compile-time tests are isolated to mitigate their noise in test coverage
reports.

Test expected values should always be immutable and immune to memory overwrites.

Care should be taken to initialize a test's expected value(s) after call to the
function, method, or system under test (SUT) to help avoid overflow issues.

Unit tests for experimental code (mostly code utilizing manual memory
management) are hosted in the `test_driver_experimental` executable.

All Catch2 host targets support the Catch2 command-line options, such
as `--help` option. This means that tests can be filtered by tags. For example:

```bash
benchmark_driver '[sorting]'
```

### Code coverage

All code lines and branches are covered with tests, with the coverage percentage
maintained at 100%.

Code coverage reports are generated with
[Clang Source-based Code Coverage](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SourceBasedCodeCoverage.html).

### Dynamic analysis

All build targets are built with Clang and Xcode sanitizers, Microsoft STL
debugging checks, and on Linux, the major targets are tested with Valgrind.

See the CI configuration for more details.

### Fuzz tests

Fuzz tests for a selection of solutions are included under the `fuzz` directory,
all of which are developed within the Google FuzzTest and GTest frameworks.

It is not a goal of this work to have a fuzz test for each solution provided.

### Automated continuous integration

CI for building, testing (with the exception of fuzz testing), benchmarking,
dynamic analysis, and some static analysis, including security static analysis,
is hosted on
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/oboukli/misc-problem-solutions/actions).

Fuzz testing, static analysis with Clang Tidy, and code style checking with
Clang Format are not enabled on GitHub Actions to avoid over-utilization of CI
resources.

## Leveraging artificial intelligence

Some configuration, e.g. that for CMake, may or may not leverage AI tools
(ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot). However, the solutions themselves are not
AI-assisted.

In this Git repository, any commit that contain AI-generated code or AI-assisted
configuration is labeled as AI-assisted in the body of the Git commit message. In
addition GitHub pull request containing AI-assisted commits are labeled as such.

Some code or text in this repository may be reviewed with AI and not marked as
such if no AI-output is considered in the final work.

Work under the `contrib/` directory may contain AI-generated code.

This document is written by the owner of the repository and is not AI-generated.

## Problem-specific notes

### Encoding and decoding strings

The strategy does not implement error detection and error reporting.

### Meeting Rooms

The strategy of function `forfun::meeting_rooms::can_attend` relies on the input
being presorted. The function does not sort (and does not, in any other way,
mutate) the input. This is mainly to avoid the overhead of sorting in case the
input is already sorted, among other considerations.

Usage example:

```cpp
std::array intervals{
    forfun::meeting_rooms::interval{.start = 16, .end = 17},
    forfun::meeting_rooms::interval{.start = 14, .end = 15},
    forfun::meeting_rooms::interval{.start = 10, .end = 11},
    forfun::meeting_rooms::interval{.start = 13, .end = 14},
};

std::ranges::sort(
    intervals, {}, &forfun::meeting_rooms::interval::start
);

bool const result{forfun::meeting_rooms::can_attend(
    intervals.cbegin(), intervals.cend()
)};
```
